## Hi, I'm Paul! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a passionate Back-End Developer, DevOps Engineer and Database Administrator with a specialization in building scalable systems and optimizing databases. I recently graduated from the ALX Software Engineering Program, where I honed my skills in designing and implementing back-end services using cutting-edge technologies like Node.js, Python, Javascripts, PostgreSQL, Oracle databases, MongoDB, SQLServer, MySQL and cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and Google cloud.

With a professional background as a Database Administrator, I bring in-depth knowledge of managing databases, optimizing performance, and ensuring data integrity. I love solving complex problems, improving system efficiency, and collaborating on projects that make an impact.

Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects!
